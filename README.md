## 📖 Project Vision
ParkPilot is an autonomous drone solution born from a personal mission. It is designed to ensure that families with disabled children always have access to the parking spots they legally deserve. By providing a 24/7, zero-tolerance enforcement guardian, ParkPilot reduces manual inspection time by **80%** and ensures accessibility through high-precision robotics.

## 🌟 Key Functionalities
* **Autonomous Surveillance:** Executes precision flight missions over large urban parking lots using MAVSDK-Python.
* **Smart Barcode Detection:** Utilizes an OpenCV/PyZbar vision pipeline to scan for "Special Needs" permits with 100% identification accuracy.
* **Intelligent Safety:** Integrated **Battery RTL Failsafe**; the drone monitors voltage in real-time and triggers an autonomous Return-to-Launch at a **15% threshold**.
* **Precision Navigation:** Uses $1 \times 10^{-5}$ GPS offsets to center the drone perfectly over target vehicles for stable scanning.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Autopilot:** PX4 Autopilot (SITL)
* **Offboard Control:** MAVSDK-Python
* **Simulation:** Gazebo Classic
* **Communication:** ROS 2 GZ Bridge (MAVLink Telemetry + ROS2 Vision Feed)
* **Vision:** OpenCV & PyZbar
* **Vehicle:** Holybro x500 V2 (Vision-enabled)

## 🏙️ World Design & 3D Pipeline
To eliminate **ODE Physics Lag** and achieve a high Real-Time Factor (RTF), a custom 3D optimization pipeline was implemented:

1.  **Asset Sourcing:** Urban assets acquired from Sketchfab and CGTrader.
2.  **Optimization:** Converted high-poly `OBJ/BLEND` files to optimized **DAE (Collada)** and **SDF** formats.
3.  **Collision Management:** Simplified collision meshes to ensure smooth physics calculations during autonomous flight.

---

## 🧠 Challenges Overcome
* **Physics Jitter:** Solved ODE lag by re-engineering collision boundaries for the urban environment.
* **Vision Stability:** Implemented a **7-second loiter logic** to stabilize the gimbal and camera feed for perfect recognition.
* **Sync Issues:** Configured a robust **ROS-GZ Bridge** to handle the high-bandwidth image data from Gazebo to the Python script.
